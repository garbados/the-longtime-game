   "There is plenty out there in the void:
    asteroids of more iron than the Longtime could ever use,
    strange rocks formed in otherworldly conditions,
    and of course, the emptiness,
    which the Peoples of Homeworld have decided to fill.
    The orbital shipyard, situated to hang idly near the planet,
    encompasses the infrastructure necessary
    to produce equipment and vehicles
    for even more exploration and development,
    from mining trawlers that consume the stone-belt
    that separate the inner and outer planets,
    to the automated processions of hovering drones
    that piece by piece assemble the seeds
    of an ambitious place for us all
    among the stars."))

   "A strip of land and air floats between worlds,
    which circles back on itself in a vast band,
    the Ring of the Lotus -- a permanent dwelling for millions.
    Manicured habitats give natural environs to all of the world's Peoples,
    though the inverted horizon will trouble the newcomers
    even if only for the first few generations.
    There is no especial purpose for the Lotus;
    it is an expression of ambition, to place ourselves in eternity,
    to gift every new generation a boundless canvas
    that one, in stewarding, may paint
    with every imaginable color."))

   "Homeworld teems with complexity.
    Hearts of industry sit beside ancient forests;
    grasses grow and forges burn;
    hooves cross ancestral steppes along old paths;
    seasons come and go, rising as they ever have.
    And like the dawn, the people burn bright:
    brilliant, exuberant, capable, compassionate;
    even greater worlds blossom on their dreams.
    Advancements in electromagnetics have permitted
    the development of ion engines so large,
    so finely controlled,
    that they might be suspended in the ring of a Ringworld.
    A megacity that might travel the stars of its own volition!
    The ship-to-be is named the Shepherd,
    for it will keep the people as the people have kept the world,
    in love and joy and peace.
    Planetary elation accompanies its embarkation,
    as the Peoples of Homeworld set out for the unknown."))
