# *The Longtime*: Skills

There are six skills:

- Athletics: pursuits of physical prowess. Contributes to the herd's carry limit; improves festivals and spelunking.
- Craftwork: tool-crafting and mechanism-engineering. Used to manufacture tools and construct buildings.
- Geology: mining, stone-knowledge. Concerns stone- and ore-gathering.
- Herbalism: plant gathering. Improves gathering yields for food and natural goods.
- Medicine: produce poultices and rations.
- Organizing: record-keeping and event-managery. Causes syndicates to form; enables exploration.

Each individual has a rating in these skills ranging from 0 to 5, or: unfamiliar, novice, learned, adept, expert, and virtuoso. Individuals also have passion in between 0 and 3 skills; this number may increase or decrease in their lifetime, as events occur.

A herd has a collective skill rating that combines the skill ratings of all individuals in the herd -- factoring in fulfillment, sickness, and hunger -- which may apply as a modifier on a project's effect, or to cross a threshold. Collective skill ratings represent a combination of knowledge and ability: a herd without enough skill for something lacks the knowledge or the ability to enact it.
