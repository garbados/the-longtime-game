# *The Longtime*: Needs

At the end of each month, the herd consumes nutrition and poultices. Nutrition can come as either food or rations, though medical needs can only be satisfied by poultices.

If the herd does not have enough nutrition, it goes hungry -- its hunger increases by 1. At 4 hunger, the herd disbands. If it has enough nutrition, its hunger returns to 0. Hunger imposes a 20% skill reduction per point.

If the herd does not have enough poultices, it becomes sick. The deficit, as a proportion of the population, reduces skills accordingly. Sickness accrues month to month.
