# *The Longtime*: The Path

*We have traveled this path since before the time of words. It has become what it is because of us, and we become us through it.*

The ancestral migration path of your herd is known colloquially as *the Path*, and composes a core game mechanic. The path contains *stages*, which have one or more possible *locations*. Each stage may have up to four locations, each of a different terrain.

The Path has four stages at first, each with a single location, but more locations can be added to the next stage with the *Explore* project. The *Elongate Path* project, which has much higher organizational requirements, allows you to add stages to the path. Longer paths allow for larger herds!

Each month, you travel from one stage to the next, choosing your next location from the locations in the next stage. If you travel to a location with steppe terrain, the herd crosses it quickly, without passing the month. This allows you to optionally skip stages, when advantageous.
