# *The Longtime*: The Path

*We have traveled this path since before the time of words. It has become what it is because of us, and we become us through it.*

The ancestral migration path of your herd is known colloquially as *the Path*, and composes a core game mechanic. The path contains *stages*, which have one or more possible *locations*. Some locations are *shortcuts*, and move you to the next stage without advancing the calendar.

The Path has four stages at first -- plains, forest, mountain, steppe -- but after the first time around, a massive earthquake creates canyons across the land as undersea rivers subsume the surface. This expands the path to six stages, adding a jungle and swamp to the rotation.

Each stage may have up to three locations. Once the next stage has three locations, "Explore" ceases to be a valid project.
