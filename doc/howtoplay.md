# How to Play *The Longtime*

The game takes place over months and years. The herd begins in a plains, turned over underhoof and favored by the highest winds, ready for an era of agriculture to begin. It will spend the month there, devoting itself to various efforts. What they do *is* the Longtime, just as much as it is a spirit of eternity; just as much as it is the potential of doing, it is the specific result of each day, and the accumulation of such days, for eons and eons.

As the Longtime, you decide what the herd does each month and where it goes next. You choose three projects, one at a time. Some projects have requirements that must be satisfied before they can be chosen, so you can check with `projects` to list all of them. You can also search projects with `search [query]` which will look for the query term in project names, descriptions, and tooltips. As you have for generations, it would behoove you to start with some *grazing*.

Once you have chosen the month's projects, some things happen by the herd's will and needs alone. Regarding needs, the herd consumes nutrition and poultices at the end of each month, to prevent hunger and sickness respectively. Nutrition can come either as food or rations; rations keep and can be moved, but you can always get food by grazing. (You can get *lots* of food from crops!) Meanwhile, poultices are derived from food, by sifting the medicinal elements of the many things Minots are known to eat. Hunger and sickness both reduce the herd's collective skills, and if they get too high, the herd will disband -- ending the Longtime.

The month closes with the possibility of a dream -- a prayer, from an individual of the herd. They will ask for guidance, or reflect on events, and may prompt you for a decision. Of course, they are only consulting themselves.

Finally, you choose the next location. The herd's migration path is organized into stages, of up to four locations of different terrains each. When you move to the next stage, you select from among its locations. If you move to a steppe location, the herd can cross it easily without advancing the calendar.

As you enter a location, an event may occur. This is something the herd has to face alone: a plague, a fire, the end of a journey or the faces of misfortune. Good things happen too, of course. All things happen, in the great span.

Then you select projects once more, and the cycle begins again.

That's the Longtime.
