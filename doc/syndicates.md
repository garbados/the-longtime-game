# *The Longtime*: Syndicates

Syndicates are doctrinal labor organizations; minots have organized their work this way for a very long time. Each represents an ethos, a synthesis of two skills, and trains those passionate in them. Their structure increases the effective capabilities of the herd in its disciplines.

Herds *elect* syndicates when the organizational capacity exists to support them; likewise, they disband when the capacity disappears. This election process is fully autonomous within the herd and does not involve the player.

During an election, each individual votes for three skills, ranked by passion and proficiency. That is, even a low-skill individual will vote for a particular skill if they are passionate in it, just as high-skill individuals, however apathetic, would feel obligated to share their expertise. The top two skills form the ethos of the new syndicate. (If that syndicate already exists, a random possibility from the next stage of popular pairs is selected instead. This process repeats until a valid candidate is found.)
