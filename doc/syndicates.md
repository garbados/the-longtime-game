# *The Longtime*: Syndicates

Syndicates are doctrinal labor organizations; minots have organized their work this way for a very long time. Each represents an ethos, a synthesis of two skills, and trains those passionate in them. Their structure increases the effective capabilities of the herd in its disciplines.

Herds *elect* syndicates when the organizational capacity exists to support them. This election process is fully autonomous within the herd and does not involve the player. Syndicates are not known to disband, as they become interwoven with the Longtime and its culture.

During an election, each individual votes for three skills, ranked by passion and proficiency. That is, even someone practically unfamiliar with a skill may still vote for it if they are passionate in it, just as adepts, however apathetic, would feel obligated to share their expertise. The top two skills form the ethos of the new syndicate. (If that syndicate already exists, a random possibility from the next stage of popular pairs is selected instead. This process repeats until a valid candidate is found.)
