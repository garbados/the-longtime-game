# *The Longtime*: Calendar

Each year there are four seasons -- spring, summer, fall, and winter -- and in each season three months. The exact length of a month is left to the player's imagination.

Different seasons have different effects. Forest and Swamp locations become un-depleted in Spring. Additionally, Forest locations gain thicker flora in Spring. Plains can be sown with crops in Spring. Crops can be harvested in Summer and Fall, but go "wild" in the Winter. Wild crops become unharvestable. If left wild, it will drain the land of nutrients. Grazing is half as effective in Winter.
