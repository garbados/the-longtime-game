# *The Longtime*: Projects

Each month, the herd enacts three projects. Projects are collective efforts such as grazing, sewing and harvesting crops, producing tools or rations, constructing buildings, etc.

Projects usually have requirements, including resource and skill thresholds. Resources required are generally consumed, and often relevant skills will provide a bonus to the project's effect. More projects will become available as your herd grows in expertise and plenitude.
