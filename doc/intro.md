# The Longtime

A game about change, and minotaurs.

Take on the role of a minot herd's revered spirit of the collective, the thread of all their shared dreams, *the Longtime*, and influence their monumental efforts as they traverse an ancient migration path.

*Are you there, Longtime? It's me, Ibba. I don't know what to do... but, maybe you do.*

Answer dreams and prayers, and become a part of a society that shifts with the earth, and shifts the earth in turn.

## Introduction

The game runs in a terminal shell, like Bash or ZSH or whatever. It communicates via a printed interface, and receives signals from text input. **It is not playable yet** and primarily exists as an encoding of game concepts and mechanics.

To begin, select a name for your save. Your herd will call you by this name, so it defaults to *Longtime*. Understand as you choose a name that it will often be prefixed with a definite article ("the") so if you use your name, be prepared for, "I spoke with the {yourname}."

Then, your starting herd is generated. Skill points, years lived, and traits (good and bad!) are distributed among 100 minots. Some of them will probably be children, and some of them will probably be elderly. Two elections are held to form two syndicates, the herd's ancestral specialties. After that, your first month on the plains occurs.

There are twelve months in a year, and each month is spent in a new location. At each location, you may direct the herd to take on up to three projects, selected from a list drawn from some defaults, some conditionals, and plenty of possibilities depending on the herd's collective skills.

Every time you travel to your next location, an event occurs. You, the player, have no influence over the event or how the herd handles it. You can only watch as they think, and struggle, for themselves.

Your migration path has many *stages*, and each stage has up to three locations. At the end of each month, you travel to one of the locations at the next stage of your migration path. You can increase your options for the next stage, and certain events will even add entirely new stages. Some locations act as shortcuts, advancing you to the next-next stage without expending another month. Eventually, you may even construct your own shortcuts!

As you leave each location, you will receive the prayers of the herd. They will consult you in dream, asking how to spend their lives, whether to have a child, or simply to protect the wellbeing of the herd. Of course, you *are* the herd. They are only asking themselves.

This process of projects and travel encapsulates the game's core loop. Projects accrue and utilize resources, place infrastructure, and add locations to future stages. The herd requires food, medicine, and tools to do the business of their daily lives, and it falls to you, to them, to plan wisely in order to sew what will be needed, and return to it when it is ready.

## Acknowledgements

I owe much to Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld, and Frostpunk for the city-builder heart of *The Longtime*. But I don't want to watch my pawns scurry, compelled by my inscrutable menus. I want the inspiration I bestow to be succinct and decisive, abstracted from physicality just as the player's very avatar is. I want to be the heart of their dreams. So I made this game.
