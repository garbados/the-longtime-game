# *The Longtime*: Minots

Minot herds have roamed the Guran-Imun-Yuliak supercontinent for millions of years, primarily as herds of ungulate-primates behaviorally indistinct from the goats and sheep and bears of their environs. But over time, something changed. They remember it as *the moment of the word*.

*Before the word, there was only deed and feeling and feeling driving deed and deed sewing feeling. Our feet crossed continents in wakeless dream for sleepless eons, trampling the earth, spreading seeds and creating fecund reaches from sea to sea.*

*Then it was there, the word: **we**. It leapt from cognizance like lightning, striking the herd and startling us all at once, but... not into a stampede. We sat and looked at each other, sat in the scent of us. We saw where we had gone, and how we had changed it, felt in the grain of our very fur how it had changed us. Suddenly those choices had a weight greater than this or that moment, or even any of our lifetimes. We were making something all at once, as one great thing. In those primordial utterances, the Longtime was born.*

*Fire. Clay. Metal. Crops and their rotation, seasons and weather and stars. We used our combined wisdom to make a clever path for us in life, a long bright day for all to come, from the bounty of the earth we had spent so long turning over and over -- as though we had prepared the way for ourselves.*

*Perhaps the Longtime preceded even we who embody it.*
