# *The Longtime*: Notes

## Regarding population curves

A herd, absent hunger and sickness, will reach some optimal population and hover around that value consistently.

*Journeyed* individuals return to the herd, or beseech it for the first time, to commit to its Longtime. Usually this is done around the age of 20. Children, and particularly infant mortality, are abstracted away; only journeyed individuals constitute the Longtime.

Each month, some number of adults complete their journeying, and some number of adults die of old age. The number of journeyings is calculated first, and a drift is applied based on the delta of an optimal population.

*Journeying* is a term for an adulthood ritual in which an individual survives one year on a solitary migration, and returns to where they started. Sometimes journeying individuals will join other herds for a few seasons, or live like an aurochs in the woods, or camp civilly with rations aplenty. Journeying confers one skill point, one passion, and one good trait.

Journeying may also refer any migratory commitment a minot makes to a herd, and so adult minots that choose to join a herd are said to *come in from their journey* just the same as returning herdlings.

## Regarding place descriptions

When you visit a location, after its event, a description is generated from three elements. One of them is terrain-related, and two are generated from traits in the herd. That is, two *moments* occur, which pair a character selector with a short text blurb.

The location blurb uses a function to map the location into a *remark*, which involves no characters. This may comment on the plains being grassy, a building existing, or the absence of buildings.

## Regarding Lodges

A lodge requires wood, stone, and tools, but mostly wood. They seem meaningless until you have several, and then several more. With enough lodges, complex relationships to the species lodging there will emerge, and *contact events* will play. Which people you contact will vary based on how many you have already contacted.

Early contacts:

- Auter: *Pluriversity*
- Harp: *Flying-market*
- Felidar: *Chargepot-generator*
- Er'sol: *Eldermothertree*

Mid contacts

- Dod: *Mag-launchpad*
- Saurek: *Port-cove*

Late contacts

- Haroot: *Launch shipyard requisites*
- Rak: *Atomic-reactor*
- Dabulan: *Launch ringworld requisites*

Within each tier, the next contact is random.
